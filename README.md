I accidentally named my output file the same as my inpur file (oops) so I overwrote the file 


Practical Four for Introduction to Computational Genomics

This practical is intended to help you get used to julia commands and and coding. 

Download this repository, and create a Julia script that EITHER takes in the sequences.txt or practical\_four.fasta and creates and saves a distance matrix of all sequences to all sequnces
You are not allowed to hardcode filename variables. (Think ArgParse) in Julia 

Then call your julia script with practical.sh, please hardcode your input/output variables there
